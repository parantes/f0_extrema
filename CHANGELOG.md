## [0.9.3] - 2022-10-23
### Fixed
- Throw error message if no extreme points are found in the f0 contour.
- Fixed a bug raised when no extreme point of one of the four types was found  in a contour.

### Added
- Option to save f0 and f0 velocity contours (in "multiple files" mode).
- Print smooth value, median and duration for each file in the Praat Info window (in "multiple files mode").

## [0.9.2] - 2019-07-31
### Changed
- Procedure "pointp_to_table" now uses Praat built-in functions to convert a PointProcess to a Table.

## [0.9.1] - 2019-07-19
### Added
- Constant extrapolation at boundaries of Pitch object to avoid abrupt changes when there are unvoiced gaps at the start and end of the contour. 

## [0.9] - 2019-01-08
### Changed
- Complete rewrite of script.
- Greatly simplified extreme points finding by applying "To PointProcess (extrema)" function after Pitch -> Matrix -> Sound conversion.
- Velocity contour generated by applying a formula.

### Removed
- Contour plotting.
- Option to save intermediate forms of f0 contour.
- Option to convert H and L extremes to S(ame) by applying a glissando threshold.

## [0.1.0] - 2008-11-25
### Added
- Script created.
